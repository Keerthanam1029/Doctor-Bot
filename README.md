# Doctor-Bot
     A chat bot which helps people to solve any queries regarding chronic kidney disease.
     
     Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body.

     In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired.
     
     This chat bot is really useful to people to clarify their queries like symptoms, risk factors etc,.
